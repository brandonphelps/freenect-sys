I am not maintaining this to match the versions of libfreenect. 
I didn't find an existing rust bindings for libfreenect so I pushed
this up for my own projects. 

If this i useful feel free to use it as you see fit. 


# Building

## Linux
pretty sure you'll need libudev on linux. 

## Windows

not sure if this works on windows.
